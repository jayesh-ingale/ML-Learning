# Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Machine Learning, where I practice concepts by implementing them on real datasets using Python and popular ML libraries.

The goal of this repo is learning by doing, building strong fundamentals, and tracking progress consistently.
